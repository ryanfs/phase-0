- What is a wireframe?
  - A visual guide (usually a black and white outline) that represents the framework of a website. They're created in the beginning of the design process. 
- What are the benefits of wireframing?
  - It defines the information hierarchy of the design and makes it easier to lay out the site when you get to the next phase of the design. It also helps you wrap your head around the design before you begin coding. 
- Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
  - Very much, I don't get to do this type of thing enough, and design is a lot of fun! 
- Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
  - There wasn't a round of creation and a round of revision. For me it was more about iterating off of the original idea to get it to look how I want. Since this was a fairly simple exercise, I was able to do it with fewer revisions than in a more complex project. 
- What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
  - I wasn't sure whether to wireframe the whole thing, or to just do sections. 
- Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
  - I enjoyed following the grids of the wireframe - getting it to be geometric and symmetrical. Some of the things someone else found tediuos I actually found to be soothing.
