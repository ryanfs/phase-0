<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
  - It was fun! Being able to look at a website, mentally deconstruct it, and then rebuild it from scratch is a cool power to have.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
  - Not too bad, the resources are readily available as long as you know what to search for :)
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
  - We ended up writing the markup and then refactoring to make sure it was in line with best practices.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
  - It's different from scripting languages because indents don't matter, which can lead to bad habits. It's good though because you can read the code and get a pretty good mental picture of the structure of your page.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
  - It's very semantic, which is helpful. One trick I have is to say "unordered list" as opposed to "ul" out loud, which is helpful.
