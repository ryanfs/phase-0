2. What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
  - The primary goal of my site is to serve as a hybrid portfolio/resume site.The type of content I'm going to feature are person projects, contact information, and professional information.
3. What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
  - My target audience is prospective employers, colleagues, and people in the software engineering space.
4. What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
  -The primary action people will take is to view my portfolio, and get a sense of who I am as a person. The secondary action for people to take is to get in contact.
5. What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
  -The main thing to know is that you should design things for the user (as opposed to for yourself). If you can get into the habit of being empathetic towards your end user (actual web app user, employer, etc) then your site will be much more usable than it would otherwise.
  - People should understand the difference between "style" and "design." They are often conflated, but "style" is just how something looks. Design is how it works, how you feel while you're interacting withh it, how easy it is to use, and the story that the product tells.
6. What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
  - User experience design incorporates usability, accessibility, design, ergonomics, and marketing. It's the entire experience someone has when interacting with your work and product. UX is really important when designing complex systems, it's imperitive to take care with the UX, otherwise people will be confused and potentially abandon using your product.
7. Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
  - I think design is really important and can often be overlooked by "hardcore programmers." I didn't find much of this experience tedious. If I had to pick *something* I guess I'd go with git. But even that is getting easier with more practice.
