## 1.1 Think About Time

- I read about the ideas in each of the links, diving deeper into both flow and creating habits. In order to dig deeper into flow, I listened to the [Mixergy Podcast featuring Steven Kotler](http://mixergy.com/interviews/steven-kotler-flow-genome/). He's the founder of the Flow Genome Project, which is committed to mapping the genome of Flow by 2020.

It went into the ideas of "hacking flow" by setting off the flow triggers (controlling your breathing, working on things that are just a little outside of your knowledge base).

- Time Boxing is the idea of working on some objective for a given period of time (as opposed to working on it until you reach the goal, and then analyzing why it took that amount of time). It encourages taking breaks and using bursts of time to your advantage instead of working against the clock.

- I currently trying and loosely use the Pomodoro technique, but often times it's difficult because I cannot stop other people from interrupting me.

- It's not working beautifully because I don't have a trigger that forces me into using the technique (and will sometimes go days without using any techniques). Also it's difficult to stop people from tapping me on the shoulder.

- My plan for Phase 0 time management is to set aside a particular period of time on certain days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday) when I know I'll have the time to commit my full attention to the work. I plan to set myself up for success by choosing that time ahead of time, committing to it, and making it my first priority. I won't chose difficult times to follow through on (e.g. Friday night & Saturday night), I'll choose times that make sense and will work.

It's all documented on my personal calendar.

## 1.2 The Command Line

What is a shell? What is "bash?"
Shell gives you access to the operating language by entering commands. It's the equivalent of the GUI desktop but through the command line.

Bash is an configurable environment that gives access to Shell.

What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?
Internalizing the different use cases to use the terminal instead of using the regular GUI desktop.

Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?
Yes

In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?
ls, pwd, cd,

Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.
-**pwd** displays your current directory path

-**ls** lists all of the files and directories in your current directory

-**mv** moves a file

-**cd** move up or down directories

-**../** go back a directory

-**touch** open a file

-**mkdir** make directory

-**less** shows a screens worth of text from a txt file

-**rmdir** removes a directory

-**rm** removes a file and all its belongings

-**help** displays a list of available commands

## 1.4 Forking and Cloning

 - If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?
The first thing I would do is link someone to the standard GitHub docs explaining how to create, fork, and clone a repo. If I had to write my own instructions, I would do very tactical step by step instructions with screenshots, listing each and every command - just like the instructions you DBC provides.

What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
 - I actually already had it set up, so it wasn't a problem this time around. In the past I've had issues
