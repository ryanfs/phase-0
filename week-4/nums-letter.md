- What does puts do
  - Puts prints the output to the console witha new line. It also returns nil... but what does that mean?

- What is an integer, what is a float?
  - An integer is a number with a decimal and a float is a number with a decimal.

- What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to a non-programmer?
  - Float division is the same as division in math, it will evaluate the actual math answer. Float division will evaluate the "right" answer, which means it will round down. A good example is if you have 9 dollars and want to buy as many possible items that each cost 4 dollars, how many can you buy? 9/4 in this case will equal 2.

```ruby
# Program to calculate hours in a year
24 * 365

# Program to calculate minutes in a decade
60 * 24 * 365 * 10

```
