    <h1>Getting used to git and GitHub</h1>
    <p>There are a ton of benefits of version control. The main benefit is giving developers (or any type of creator) revision history of the changes they've made to files. If they need to revert to a previous more stable state, it's simple to do that.</p>
    <p>Git helps you keep track of changes by storing a history of the state of your system each time you commit your files to the git repository. By giving yourself lots of checkpoints, you can traverse through time if you need to make changes. It's beneficial for distributed teams because keeping track of changes helps everyone stay organized and prevents the chance of overwriting files.</p>
    <p>GitHub is a great place to store your code because it's so tightly integrated with the git system. It's free for public code, and it's social so anyone can find your code and you can find anyone else's code. It's also beneficial to use GitHub to store your code because your profile becomes a developer portfolio, potential employers can see all of the hard work you've done over the years.</p>

<!--
 - What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
   - In this challenge I used html, meta, head, title, body, section, article, h1, p. The one I return to often is <article> because it handles many types of elements.
 - How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
   - They get laid out on the page top to bottom, and the browser uses top down order to display the elements.
 - What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
   - I'll totally make more snippets! They are great for making a boilerplate to get started. I also had no idea that typing html and hitting tab would give you the html skeleton.
