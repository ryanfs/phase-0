- How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
  - It's so important to use the inspector to get things just right. If you did trial and error in the code it would take forever. Watching the screen change with each update is super gratifying.

- How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
  - Change the height/width
- What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
  - Absolute positioning has no regard for other elements and puts the element right where you assign it. Fixed positioning is reletive to the viewport, so it's great for navs that are "glued" to the top, bottom or side. Relative positioning is relative to itself, and static positioning flows normally.

- What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?
  - Margin is the space around an element. Border can have color, style and width, and goes around the element. Padding is the space within an element and is used to blow up or shink an element.

- What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
  - Very useful challenge because knowing how to manipulate the dom is so important to developing strong front end skills.
